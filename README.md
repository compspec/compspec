A compspec (Composition spec) is a specification and model for comparing things. This means
that we take an abstract and simple approach to model complex systems as graphs (nodes
and relaionshps) and then can compare between graphs. Note that the library has been developed over time
to handle different kinds of speifications, including:

 - [Answer Set Programming (asp)](https://github.com/compspec/spec/tree/main/abi): read about the background, concepts, and design of this simple specification.
 - [Compatibility](https://github.com/compspec/spec/tree/main/compatibility): of container images and applications to a host environment.

The second is under development!

See the ⭐️ [Documentation](https://compspec.github.io/compspec) ⭐️ for basic usage
and getting started.
