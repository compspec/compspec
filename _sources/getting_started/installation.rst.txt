Installation
============

Pypi
====

The module is available in pypi as `compspec <https://pypi.org/compspec/compspec/>`_,
and you can install as follows:

.. code:: console

    $ pip install compspec
    
You can also clone the repository and install locally:

.. code:: console

    $ git clone https://github.com/compspec/compspec
    $ cd compspec
    $ pip install .
 
Or in development mode:

.. code:: console

    $ pip install -e .


Development mode means that the install is done from where you've cloned the library,
so any changes you make are immediately "live" for testing.
